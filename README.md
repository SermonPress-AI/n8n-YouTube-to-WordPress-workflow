# 📡 YouTube-First Sermon Publishing Automation (n8n Workflow) (In-Progress!)

This repository contains a no-code/low-code workflow built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) as part of my internship. The goal is to automate a YouTube-first content publishing pipeline for sermon or devotional media, reducing manual tasks and increasing reach and consistency.

## ✨ Project Overview

This workflow automates the process of publishing sermons or spiritual content primarily to YouTube, while optionally distributing metadata (title, transcript, tags, etc.) to other platforms for content generation.
