# üì° YouTube-First Sermon Publishing Automation (n8n Workflow) (In-Progress!)

This repository contains a no-code/low-code workflow built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) as part of my internship. The goal is to automate a YouTube-first content publishing pipeline for sermon or devotional media, reducing manual tasks and increasing reach and consistency.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This workflow automates the process of publishing sermons or spiritual content primarily to YouTube, while optionally distributing metadata (title, transcript, tags, etc.) to other platforms for content generation.

Current workflow:
1. Takes a form submission 
2. Stores the data in Google Sheets 
3. Creates a WordPress post with the title of the sermon.
